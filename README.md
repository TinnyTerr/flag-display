# Flag Display

## Overview

This project is to demonstrate usage of websockets, to make a F1-like flag manager for incidents around track.
Currently, we have the following features

- Flag States & Types
    - Basic flags: Green **(planned)**, Yellow **(planned)**, Double Yellow **(planned)**, Blue **(planned)**, Red **(planned)**, Black **(planned)**, White **(planned)**, Checkered **(planned)**, Surface (Also known as 'Slippery Surface') **(planned)**, Black flag with orange circle or meatball flag **(planned)**.
    - Series Specific flags:
        - (Not limited to) F1: Safety Car **(planned)**, Virtual Safety Car **(planned)**.
        - (Not limited to) WEC: Full Course Yellow **(planned)**, Slow Zones.
        - (Not limited to) NASCAR: Caution **(planned)**, local yellows (by using blue flags) **(planned)**, stage finish flag **(planned)**.
        - Others: Code 60 **(planned)**.

- Flag Triggers
    - Manual triggers **(planned)**: user clicks a button or command triggers a flag.
    - Automatic triggers **(planned)**: simulate incidents (crash, debris, weather, SC deployment).

- Display System
    - Map of the track showing all flag points with current flag. **(planned)**
    - Timed display **(planned)**: how long a flag has been active.
    - Warning system **(planned)**: logs when a flag is overdue (like Yellow too long).

- Logging **(planned)**
    - Log every flag change with timestamp.
    - Include trigger reason and location on track.
    - Keep history per session (JSON/CSV for easy playback).

- Notifications (in manual mode only) **(planned)**
    - Alerts for conflicting flags e.g., Green followed immediately by Red.
    - Alerts for flags that affect specific cars (Blue, Black).
